/*

5.13 (Factorials) Factorials are used frequently in probability problems. The factorial of a positive
integer n (written n! and pronounced “n factorial”) is equal to the product of the positive integers from
1 to n. Write an application that calculates the factorials of 1 through 20. Use type long. Display the
results in tabular format. What difficulty might prevent you from calculating the factorial of 100?

It would cause overflow, and the compiler would print 0

		for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
